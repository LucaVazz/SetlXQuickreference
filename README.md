# SetlX - Qucikrefernce
This Reference aims at providing a quick lookup for the concepts and syntax implemented in the [SetlX-Language](http://www.randoom.org/Software/SetlX).

To help you at developing via syntax highlighting, pop-up documentation of predefined functions, snippets for common structures, basic continuous syntax checking and advanced interpreter output-parsing, including error marking, also consider using my [SetlXHelper-Plugin](https://github.com/LucaVazz/SetlXHelper) for [SublimeText 3]().

For a complete Introduction / Explanation of SetlX, please refer to its ["In-Depth" Tutorial](http://download.randoom.org/setlX//tutorial.pdf) or the [corresponding lecture by Prof. Stroetmann](https://github.com/karlstroetmann/Logik).



### Contributing
Please feel free to submit your additions via Pull Requests with the extended or via issues (with an attachment) with the supplementary OneNote-Files.

If you find an error / missspelling, you can either keep it or feel free to submit an issue.

If you are eager to transfer this reference into Latex or something more *"professional"* than OneNote-Files as a source, feel free to do so and to contribute it as a pull request.<sup>(Because I don't plan to do it)</sup>
