# SetlX - Quickreference
This Reference aims at providing a quick "cheatsheet" for the concepts and the syntax implemented in the [SetlX-Language](http://www.randoom.org/Software/SetlX). *It doesn't substitute a basic understanding of the language and its concepts!*


For a complete Introduction / Explanation of SetlX, please refer to its ["In-Depth" Tutorial](http://download.randoom.org/setlX//tutorial.pdf) or the [corresponding lecture by Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmann](https://github.com/karlstroetmann/Logik).
