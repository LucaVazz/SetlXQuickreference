# SetlX - Qucikrefernce
This Reference aims at providing a quick lookup for the concepts and syntax implemented in the [SetlX-Language]().

To help you at developing via syntax highlighting, pop-up documentation of predefined functions, snippets for common structures, basic continuous syntax checking and advanced interpreter output-parsing, including error marking, also consider using my [SetlXHelper-Plugin]() for [SublimeText 3]().

For a complete Introduction / Explanation of SetlX, please refer to its [Manual]() or the [corresponding lecture by Prof. Stroetmann]().
